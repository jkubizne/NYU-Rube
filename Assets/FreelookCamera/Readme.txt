Thank you for purchasing Freelook Camera!

=====Setup=====

To get started, simply drag the FreelookCamera component from the 'FreelookCamera/Scripts' folder onto your camera.
You can also drag the prefab from 'FreelookCamera/Prefabs' in your scene


=====Usage=====

While using a camera with the FreelookCamera component attached:
- use the wasd keys to move around
- move your mouse to look around
- hold shift (if enabled in the inspector) to increase your movement speed while pressing wasd
- Press the configured hotkey (default T) to enable/disable the freelook camera

There are settings in the inspector you can change to your liking, all provided with appropriate 
tooltips explaining their function
